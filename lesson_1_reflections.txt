How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
You can see what has changed instead of looking at everything

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
You can see what has changed throughout the versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
You could be in the middle of development and not ready to commit.  If you forgot to commit and it got overwritten then you lost all your work without auto-save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Sometimes you need to update multiple files at once, single file is too slow.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
See the full update history for a file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
You can always revert

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Version control of our source code for work as there are multiple instances, projects, etc...
