What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created which is necessary to track your history.  You can run git status to see which files have changed since the last commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It is the directory that holds your files before you commit so that you can commit multiple files at once.  This helps us as you want to checkin based on functionality, so when you have finished implementing new functionality, you add all of those files to the staging area and commit them all at once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Grouping the files related to that logical change in your staging area then commit the whole staging area.
